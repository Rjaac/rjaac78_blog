            <h2>Fourth Transmission: Plugging In – A Personal Ethnography</h2>
            <p class="post-meta">DATE: 2025.04.19 // Operator // LOCATION: Setúbal Terminal //</p>

            <section id="block-1">
                <h2>Plugging In</h2>
                <p>Somewhere between a VHS tape and a blinking cursor, I plugged in. Not into the matrix, not into cyberspace—not yet—but into a time, a texture, a possibility. Born in 1978, I belonged to that narrow corridor of Portuguese kids who came of age during the slow detonation of the digital era. Before the internet, before the click, before the cloud, there were machines that buzzed and whirred and waited. There were cables and cassette decks and black screens with blinking white prompts. There were Sinclair and Spectrum computers, their rubber keys like relics from a future that hadn’t arrived yet.</p>
                <p>I didn’t grow up in Silicon Valley. I grew up in Setúbal. But I had Neuromancer in my DNA before I ever read it. Because the world it imagined—the grimy fusion of mind and machine, the aesthetic of resistance through code—was already in the air. In pirated diskettes. In cracked software. In the smell of printed circuit boards behind shop counters.</p>
                <p>This isn’t nostalgia. It’s fieldwork. A digital ethnography. An anthropological excavation of what it meant to be a human interfacing with machines in Portugal, at the cusp of something no one fully understood. I wasn’t a hacker. I wasn’t a prodigy. I was just awake.</p>
                <p>This post is about that awakening. It’s about the gap between the neon-soaked dreams of cyberpunk and the actual infrastructures of dial-up modems and paper-perforated printers. It’s about how those dreams shaped a mind that didn’t follow the path—but never stopped tracing the map.</p>

                <h2>VHS Visions: The Films That Formed a Generation</h2>
                <p>Before cyberspace was a term, it was a dream—projected not on screens, but on magnetic tape. If you were born in the mid-to-late 70s and had access to a VCR, you didn’t need a modem to glimpse the matrix—you had Wargames, Electric Dreams, Lawnmower Man, and Johnny Mnemonic. Films that weren’t just science fiction, but neural blueprints for how we would come to imagine computers, consciousness, and control.</p>
                <p>I watched them young. Too young, maybe—but just right to be altered. Wargames turned the idea of dialing into a machine into something thrilling and subversive. Electric Dreams blurred the line between emotion and code. Lawnmower Man was chaos and transcendence through digital enhancement. And Johnny Mnemonic? That one was religion. Data as burden. Memory as currency. Minds as smuggled software.</p>
                <p>Long before The Matrix turned simulation into mainstream fashion, these films were whispering to us through grainy frames and imperfect tracking. They weren’t accurate, but they were prophetic—and that mattered more. Because by the time I powered up my first real PC and heard the brutal, beautiful screech of the dial-up modem, I knew exactly what was happening.</p>
                <p>I wasn’t just connecting. I was jacking in.</p>
                <p>These VHS tapes weren’t just entertainment. They were cultural injections—seeding us with anticipation, with fluency, with desire. They taught us that behind every screen was a system, and behind every system was a way to rewrite the world.</p>
                <p>And in that flickering light, some of us began to believe we could.</p>

                <h2>Infrastructure and Illusions</h2>
                <p>The internet didn’t arrive in Portugal with a bang. It seeped in, slow and humming, through copper wires and blinking modems. The infrastructure was nothing like the slick grids of cyberspace imagined in Neuromancer. No ICE walls. No data thrones. Just phone lines, analog noise, and the ghostly hum of electrical current fighting to carry dreams.</p>
                <p>Connection meant compromise. You waited for your parents to finish their calls. You prayed no one picked up the extension mid-transfer. You listened—ritualistically—to the screech and chug of the dial-up, a sound more memorable than any pop song: brruuuuu… buu buu trrrmmm… tchuka tchuka… kachunk… silence… access granted.</p>
                <p>The first real portals came in the form of Netpac—those blue boxes that offered 10 hours of connection per month and a free @clix or @telepac email address. Before that? BBS boards, university links, cracked access. Information wasn’t free—it was scavenged.</p>
                <p>The hardware was equally unglamorous: beige towers with 486 processors, CRT monitors with static crackle, and external modems that looked like alien bricks. Cabling was messy. Configurations were arcane. Speed was measured in patience, not megabits.</p>
                <p>But behind the rawness, there was magic. Because while Gibson wrote of jacking into networks through neural ports, we were doing the same—just with less elegance and more sweat. Each successful connection felt like breaching a wall no one else could see.</p>
                <p>Infrastructure in Portugal was never beautiful. But for those of us who learned to ride its broken waves, it was enough to feel like hackers of reality.</p>

                <h2>Schools, Labs, and Monolithic Learning</h2>
                <p>If cyberspace was infinite, school was a box. Not a virtual one—an actual, stuffy, windowless room with humming machines and fluorescent lights. The computer lab.</p>
                <p>In Portugal’s public schools of the late 80s and early 90s, “informatics” was both exotic and rigid. It was taught to specific classes, often labeled “Turma D,” like a quiet admission that this wasn’t real curriculum—it was a technical elective for those who didn’t fit elsewhere. We didn’t explore; we obeyed. We followed manuals. We typed what we were told. Creativity was an error. Improvisation was a failure.</p>
                <p>The computers were often Amstrads or 286s, depending on funding. Boot-up was slow. The air smelled of plastic and dust. There were dot matrix printers that screamed as they printed page after page on perforated paper, which we tore off like sacred scrolls of binary truth.</p>
                <p>There were rules. No disks from home. No changing system files. No fun.</p>
                <p>Yet for some of us, even within this rigid structure, something stirred. We peeked into the DOS prompt when no one was watching. We edited AUTOEXEC.BAT just to see if it would still boot. We copied lines of BASIC from a book just to watch a screen flash “HELLO.”</p>
                <p>School didn’t know what to do with us. It wanted workers, not explorers. It gave us hardware, but no mythos. So we built our own. Outside the classroom, with magazines, friends, pirated disks, and curiosity.</p>
                <p>Inside the lab, we were students. Outside, we were already users.</p>

                <h2>WordStar, dBase and the Missed Fork</h2>
                <p>Before I ever wrote a blog post, I typed in WordStar. Before I understood what a database was, I was running commands in dBase II. I was twelve years old, maybe younger—still in primary school but already holding onto keyboards like they were relics from some future vocation I couldn’t name.</p>
                <p>I took two courses. One in WordStar, where formatting meant Ctrl-K and every function felt like invoking a spell. The other in dBase, where I learned to USE, APPEND, REPLACE, and BROWSE long before I understood spreadsheets or logic gates. I wasn’t trained—I was initiated.</p>
                <p>But then came the fork. Math. Cold, sharp-edged, merciless math. I didn’t understand it, and worse—I feared it. It wasn’t explained; it was wielded. Teachers and parents saw numbers as proof of intelligence. I saw them as traps. And so, when the time came to choose a path, I fled. Not from tech itself, but from the specter of failure it seemed to guarantee.</p>
                <p>I followed health sciences. Later, communication. Fields where my natural instincts—observation, language, connection—could live, but not thrive as they might have in tech. I didn’t become a coder. I didn’t join the early web pioneers. But I never lost the spark.</p>
                <p>Sometimes I wonder: had someone translated math into story, into purpose—would I have taken the other path?</p>
                <p>Even so, I kept the skills. I may have missed the fork, but I kept the map.</p>

                <h2>Space Quests and Command Lines</h2>
                <p>Before pointing and clicking became the norm, we wrote our intentions. We typed them into existence, one verb and noun at a time. That was the world of Space Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, King’s Quest, and Police Quest—the parser-era of Sierra On-Line.</p>
                <p>I remember loading Space Quest II and being greeted not by music or menu, but by a blinking cursor that asked, almost humbly:</p>
                <p><em>What do you want to do?</em></p>
                <p>And I answered. In English. At twelve. LOOK AROUND, PICK UP ROCK, USE TERMINAL. Sometimes it worked. Often it didn’t.</p>
                <p>“I don’t understand that.” A brutal, pure rejection. But I kept trying.</p>
                <p>These games were more than entertainment. They were language drills, logic puzzles, interfaces for thought. Every action had to be imagined, phrased, refined. You didn’t just play—you conversed with the machine.</p>
                <p>In a way, Sierra trained us to talk to computers long before Alexa or ChatGPT. And they did it with sarcasm, danger, and death. You could trip on stairs, insult an alien, or forget to save, and boom—you were dead. Again.</p>
                <p>But with every failure came understanding. Syntax. Sequence. Semantics. We learned to see logic not as math, but as story. These games taught us how to think computationally—without us ever realizing.</p>
                <p>Today, GUIs shield users from the machine’s raw edge. Back then, the edge was all we had. And in learning how to speak to it, we discovered that language was power.</p>

                <h2>The Ritual of the Game Box</h2>
                <p>Buying a game in the 90s wasn’t just a transaction—it was a rite of passage. Games weren’t downloaded or streamed. They were hunted, debated, saved for, and finally carried home in towering boxes that felt more like relics than retail.</p>
                <p>You didn’t buy them at tech stores. You found them nestled between CDs and VHS tapes at places like Virgin Megastore and Bimotor—cathedrals of culture where digital adventures stood side-by-side with Nirvana and Kubrick. And when you picked up a box, you didn’t just look at the art—you flipped it, studied it, absorbed it.</p>
                <p>The system requirements were holy scripture:</p>
                <p><em>“Pentium 90 MHz, 16MB RAM, 2x CD-ROM, VESA-compatible SVGA.”</em></p>
                <p>We read them with religious focus, comparing every line to the specs of our own machines. Did we have the RAM? The video card? Enough free memory? Were we ready to face the setup.exe?</p>
                <p>The manuals were legends. Fallout 2, Baldur’s Gate, Planescape: Torment—these didn’t come with instructions. They came with lore. Charts. Maps. Histories. You didn’t just play the game—you entered a world that began at page one.</p>
                <p>Installing took time. Disks. Hope. Patience. And if it failed? You debugged reality.</p>
                <p>Today, games install in seconds. You click. You play. You forget. It’s magical—and a little hollow.</p>
                <p>Back then, every frame on screen was earned. Every victory was preceded by INSERT DISK 6. And that made all the difference.</p>

                <h2>The Brotherhood of AUTOEXEC</h2>
                <p>There was a secret brotherhood in the DOS era—an invisible order of users who knew. Knew what an .ARJ was. Knew how to configure CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT to free just enough memory to run X-Wing. Knew that LOADHIGH and FILES=30 were more than gibberish—they were keys to performance.</p>
                <p>We didn’t have YouTube tutorials or Discord servers. We had each other. Playground tech support. A friend’s older brother who passed down a QEMM disk. A neighbor who knew the magical HIMEM.SYS incantation. And once you met someone who spoke your language—who understood why a .ZIP file needed to be extracted, not just opened—you felt less alone. You were part of something.</p>
                <p>We’d swap diskettes like forbidden scrolls. Copy entire directory trees by hand. Spend weekends crafting the perfect boot disk just to run Doom II with sound. And when it worked? It wasn’t luck. It was wizardry.</p>
                <p>That knowledge didn’t just run games. It ran us. It taught us systems thinking. Cause and effect. Syntax and consequence. One misplaced line, and your PC wouldn’t boot. But get it right, and you’d unlocked a level of performance that felt like cheating the system.</p>
                <p>Today, operating systems hide everything behind pretty GUIs. Memory is managed. Drivers are automatic. Configs live in the cloud. It’s easier—and better, in many ways.</p>
                <p>But back then, the machine didn’t run unless you told it how. And those who could? They belonged to the brotherhood.</p>

                <h2>Magazines and the Forbidden Code</h2>
                <p>Long before Google, long before forums, there were magazines—thick, glossy portals to a world that felt just out of reach. Byte, Micro Sistemas, PC Guia, Exame Informática—each issue was a blend of technical scripture and high-tech mythology. You didn’t just read them. You decoded them.</p>
                <p>The ads were pure science fiction: servers that cost more than cars, laser printers the size of small fridges, workstations no mortal could afford. Companies like Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems, IBM—names that sounded like corporations from Neuromancer. The imagery was seductive. The price tags were terrifying.</p>
                <p>Then came the articles. Talk of logarithmic compression algorithms, binary trees, memory segmentation, Pascal and LISP. Diagrams that looked like alchemical symbols. Syntax that read like sacred code. You understood maybe 10%—but that 10% felt like power.</p>
                <p>And those program listings—pages of BASIC or Pascal code you could type line by line into your own machine. Hours of transcribing. A single typo, and nothing worked. But when it did? You felt like you’d written fire.</p>
                <p>It wasn’t just content—it was initiation. If you could read these magazines, even partially, you were already more than a user. You were an apprentice.</p>
                <p>Today, a five-minute video can teach you what a whole issue once tried to explain. And that’s beautiful.</p>
                <p>But there was something about holding those pages, staring into their dense, monospaced jungle of text, and thinking:</p>
                <p><em>Someday, I’ll understand this.</em></p>
                <p>And slowly—painfully, wonderfully—you did.</p>

                <h2>Interface and Abstraction: The Disappearing System</h2>
                <p>There was a time when you saw the system. Not the icons or the themes—the real system. File extensions. Boot sequences. Partitions. IRQ conflicts. You didn’t just use a computer. You negotiated with it.</p>
                <p>The interface was thin. A veil. Behind it, the gears were visible. You knew where files lived. You knew that .EXE ran, .BAT configured, .SYS mattered. You knew that C:\ wasn’t just a letter—it was home base. And every .DLL crash taught you a lesson.</p>
                <p>Fast forward to today: operating systems are palaces of abstraction. Apps run in sandboxes. File paths are hidden. Automatic updates rewrite code in silence. Modern users swipe, tap, and say “okay Google” without ever glimpsing the code beneath. They live on the surface of computation.</p>
                <p>And it’s not wrong. Abstraction has made technology universal. Ubiquitous. Kind. But it has also made it invisible—and therefore, for many, unknowable.</p>
                <p>A teenager today can write a tweet that reaches the world, but might not know what a directory is. Might not understand why a .zip needs to be extracted, or that files even have extensions. The operating system is now a magician who never reveals the trick.</p>
                <p>Back then, we were part of the illusion. We built the table, loaded the gun, and pulled the trigger.</p>
                <p>Now the magic still happens. Faster. Cleaner. But we, the early operators, remember what it meant to pull the curtain aside.</p>

                <h2>Not a Hacker, But a Witness</h2>
                <p>I didn’t become a hacker. I didn’t join the digital elite or build empires in code. I didn’t study computer science. I was never fluent in calculus. And that—more than anything—kept me out.</p>
                <p>Not for lack of passion. Not for lack of intuition. But because mathematics, to me, was a locked door. Cold. Opaque. Presented without grace or context. My teachers didn’t know how to teach it. My parents didn’t know how to translate it. And so I feared it. And that fear rerouted my path.</p>
                <p>Still, I watched.</p>
                <p>I watched machines evolve. Watched the transition from DOS to Windows, from dial-up to DSL, from command lines to clouds. I watched friends become sysadmins, developers, engineers. I walked a different road—health, communication, writing—but I never stopped looking back. Never stopped understanding.</p>
                <p>Because even if I wasn’t the one writing the programs, I knew how they worked. I’d lived through the rituals, fought with the configs, broken and fixed and broken again.</p>
                <p>Cyberpunk wasn’t just an aesthetic. It was an identity. It whispered: Even if you’re not on the inside, you can still see how the system works. And I did.</p>
                <p>Now, in an age of neural networks and machine learning, I use tools I never built—but I use them with the eyes of someone who remembers the shell. The boot sequence. The syntax.</p>
                <p>I may not be a hacker. But I was there. And I remember.</p>

                <h2>Legacy Mode</h2>
                <p>This isn’t nostalgia. This is a reboot.</p>
                <p>The past I’ve shared here—those screens, those sounds, those lines of code—they aren’t longing. They’re foundation. A digital adolescence forged in static and syntax. A time when you had to understand the machine to make it obey. When you could feel the system thinking.</p>
                <p>Today, everything is smoother. Faster. Smarter. And I love that. I use AI daily. I automate, I optimize, I write this blog with a machine that finishes my sentences. But the reason I use it well—the reason I’m not lost in the fog of the interface—is because I once stood at the edge of the command line and learned what it meant to speak machine.</p>
                <p>What I carry from that era isn’t just skill. It’s literacy. A way of seeing through the GUI, the app, the algorithm. Knowing that behind the swipe is a file. Behind the button is a process. Behind the system is a structure.</p>
                <p>Legacy Mode isn’t about going back. It’s about honoring the code that got us here.</p>
                <p>The blog you’re reading, the voice you hear—it’s built on those memories. Not because they were better, but because they were real. Tangible. Hard-won.</p>
                <p>We don’t need to return to floppy disks and DOS prompts. But we do need to remember them. Because even in this age of abstraction and automation, some of us still carry the kernel.</p>
                <p>And sometimes, remembering is the most powerful command of all.</p>

                <h2>P.S. – The Tupperware Protocol</h2>
                <p>My first 386 was a Madara. Twin floppy drives—A and B. One for the source, one for the copy. It felt powerful. Like a forge. And I used it like one: duplicating disks, sharing games, spreading the digital gospel. Space Quest was our scripture.</p>
                <p>There was this colleague I recorded it for—dozens of disks over days, even weeks. But every morning, he'd come back and say the same thing:</p>
                <p><em>“It’s corrupted again.”</em> Every time.</p>
                <p>At first, I thought it was bad copies. Then bad disks. Maybe even a curse. So one day, I walked home with him. We stored the disk carefully in a Tupperware box, like some kind of sacred relic. We arrived. The disk worked. Finally. But the game wouldn’t install. Some VGA/EGA conflict. A mystery for another day.</p>
                <p>I brought the disk back with me, still sealed in plastic, wondering what had changed. And then it hit me.</p>
                <p>The railroad. Every day, he crossed the tracks. The magnetic field. The pulse. The hum. Each time, it wiped his data like a ghost in the wire. The game wasn’t broken. The world was interfering.</p>
                <p>We called it "the curse of the line" for a while. But really, it was just physics reminding us that digital wasn’t immune to analog.</p>
                <p>Today, data is stored in clouds and solid-state vaults. But back then, all it took was a railway to kill a dream.</p>
                <p>And we still kept trying.</p>

                <h2>Addendum.exe – The Inforgal Summers</h2>
                <p>I didn’t get my first PC from Santa Claus. I earned it, two summers at a time.</p>
                <p>I was maybe thirteen, maybe younger. No credit lines. No parental backup. Just heat, hope, and hustle. I handed out flyers for weeks, months—any spare moment from school I could convert into work. And every second of it led me to Inforgal.</p>
                <p>It wasn’t just any store. It was one of Portugal’s first IBM-authorized home computer dealerships. A sacred space of beige towers and blinking cursors. And I wasn’t just a customer—I became part of the furniture. A local genius kid. One of the boys who demoed machines, printed test pages, made it all look easy.</p>
                <p>It was raw. Beautifully raw. People would walk into that store, watch a kid like me run DIR /P or print a WordStar file, and they’d buy a machine worth 3500€. Just like that. We sold dreams with keystrokes.</p>
                <p>When I finally bought my Madara 386, it wasn’t just a purchase. It was a summoning. Drive A, drive B. It felt like flying a shuttle.</p>
                <p>I didn’t plug in to escape. I plugged in because I had built my way in.</p>
                <p>That’s the legacy I carry—not just digital fluency, but the fire that earned it.</p>
